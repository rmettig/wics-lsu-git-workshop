I think the TV talks to me
I see things I shouldn't have seen
I left the house without the key
It crossed my mind this time

I left the keys in the car last night
Imagination was running wild
I got my phone but never charge it right
Those kinds of things they always slip my mind

When I got home and opened up the blinds
Must have forgot it wasn't broad day light
Wish I could see all the red lights flash
Just to avoid another body crash

Don't you mind
Don't you mind
Here comes Mr. Overtime
And he's cool with your friends
Keep in mind
He's one of a kind
Here comes Mr. Overtime
And he's cool with your friends

I left the keys in the car last night
Imagination was running wild
I got my phone but never charge it right
Those kinds of things they always slip my mind
