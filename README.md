# CLI Git Workshop
By Raphaela Mettig

This is a three-part workshop I developed for the Women in Computer Science at LSU workshop series. It is aimed at early-career computer science students with the goal to get them familiar with the basics of navigating a Unix environment through a terminal, as well as the basics of basic project version control with Git and Github.

- Part I - Introduction to the Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Part II - Introduction to Git
- Part III - Introduction to Collaborative Projects 

The workshop materials are still being updated, but you can find the slides from the previous iterations of the workshop in this repository for reference.
